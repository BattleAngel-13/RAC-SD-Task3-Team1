# RAC-SD-Task3-Team1
I am glad to share that we completed the third Probation task of the Software Development team of RAC - Robotics and Automation Club. My team ( Hariharan J and Praaveen D ) and I were given the Problem Statement to write a Python Script to display time and to set Alarm, Reminder and Counter Timer. From this task, I have learnt how to build a GUI window using tkinter module in Python. 

<br>The modules we imported are:
<li>plyer
<li>tkinter
<li>datetime
<li>platform
<li>winsound
